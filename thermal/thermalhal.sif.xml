<!--ThermalHAL Config
Attributes for thermal
	These must be declared as a 'thermal-prop' element node
	Attributes:
		name - name of thermal device
		type - type defined by AOSP
		sensor-label - tz name
		multiplier - converting factor to degree Celsius
		cores - only for CPU type
		threshold-label - to use a different temperature threshold
Attributes for cooling
	These must be declared as a 'cooling-prop' element node
		name - name of cooling device
		type - type defined by AOSP
		cooling-path - node that represents cooling state
Attributes for cpu-usages
	These must be part of 'cpu_usages' element node
		cpus - number of cpus in the platform-->
